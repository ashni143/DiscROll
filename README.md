# RollMyDice

The application is a game, where the Player can press a button to "Roll a dice", and get a Random result anywhere between 1 and 6, the Player gets 10 chances to play, and every time the result of the dice roll should get added to the Player's score. After 10 attempts the player's results should be logged into the leaderboard.


##Steps

1. Add required libraries from pub.dev
2. Connect project in firebase console.
3. I  am  following Stream based architecture.
4. I  am using the auth with the phone number so first step of verifying the mobile number would be the same for sign up or sign in. Afterwards if the user has not 
entered the details then the screen "Add user details" will pop otherwise not. User can edit his/her details anytime.
5. We will follow bottom navigation so there will be three tabs namely "RollDice", "LeaderBoard" and "Account".
